** structure

*oqa-transient* used as the main transient. From there select OpenQA instance.
TODO needs a better name

Then for each instance *oqa-opensuse* or *oqa-suse* is involved to display /actions/ on the selected instance.
For now a /defined-prefix/ is defined (dublicated) with different keybinding to do an API call and open a buffer with results.

TODO buffer needs to be interactive and able to open another transient for actions
